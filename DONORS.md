# Donors to the Redot Engine project

Redot Engine is a non-profit project developed by a community of voluntary
contributors, as well as occasional paid contributors thanks to the financial
support of generous donors.

The ways to donate to the project, as well as details on how the funds are
used, are described on [Redot's website](https://redotengine.org/donate).

The following is a list of the current monthly donors, who will have their
generous deed immortalized in the next stable release of Redot Engine.
