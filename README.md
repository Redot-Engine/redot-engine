# Godot Engine is still great

As a member of the game development community, I'm concerned about the recent fork of Godot Engine called 'Redot Engine.' 

While open-source software allows for forks, this particular project seems to be exploiting the hard work and goodwill of the Godot community for personal gain. 

It's disappointing to see such opportunistic behavior in our collaborative open-source ecosystem. 

I believe it's important to support ethical development practices and the original Godot Engine project, which has consistently provided a free and open platform for game creators. 

I encourage fellow developers to consider the broader impact of their actions on our community and to continue supporting projects that prioritize collective benefit over individual profit.
